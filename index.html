        <p>Francesca Stern Woodman was an American photographer best known for her black and white pictures featuring either herself or female models. 
                Many of her photographs show women, naked or clothed, blurred, merging with their surroundings, or whose faces are obscured.</p>

                <h2>Who is Francesca Woodman?</h2>
                <br>
        <p>Born in Denver, Colorado in 1958, Francesca Woodman first started taking photographs in her early teens while at boarding school. During her short career she took over 800 pictures.
She was brought up in an environment where making and talking about art were part of everyday life. Her father was a painter and photographer and also lectured in photography at the University of Boulder in Colorado. Her mother was a ceramicist and sculptor.</p>

<br>
<p>Francesca Woodman’s family spent their summers at her parents’ farmhouse in the countryside near Florence in Italy and many of her photographs were taken there. European culture and art had a significant impact on her artistic development. The influence of surrealist art, particularly the photographs of Man Ray and Claude Cahun can be seen in the themes and style of her work. She developed her ideas and skills as a student at Rhode Island School of Design.

        Francesca suffered from depression following a move to New York in 1979 and in 1981, after a failed relationship, she tragically took her own life at the age of twenty-two.</p>
